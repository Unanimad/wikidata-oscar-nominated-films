# wikidata-oscar-nominated-films

Using WikiData and a SPARQL Query, get a list of all movies that have been nominated for an Academy Award


# Background

I tried several APIs...

* OpenMovieDatabase, www.omdbapi.com/ 
* The Movie Database, www.themoviedb.org
* An older file on Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/janandd/the-revised-oscars-database
* The Academey's own, http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/

WikiData was what I settled on.  The benefits of Wikidata included

* The ability to fix the data, like publication dates.
* The ability to get the latest data
* Format the results as I would like in a machine readable format.

# Usage

Paste the *.sql file into https://query.wikidata.org/ and press the blue button.
